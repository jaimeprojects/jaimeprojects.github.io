## Goal: 
Help future college students find universites based on their prefrences

# Background
This was a semester project from my Software development class and was developed as a team effort

# Our Product:
The web applicaiton was built using the java to commect to our SQL Database that house information for a large number of unieversites.
Some of that data includes location, tuition cost, ratio of men to women.


# Notable Features
* Live chat api was implemented so that students could talk to we hosts should they have any questions we would be able to answer in real time
* University suggestions
    * Based on the university selected there was an algorithm to reccomend other schools based on certain criteria 
* Save universities to your personal account
    'favorite' schools and save them to your account for later

### How it came to be
* This project was developed in a team of 5 students, we each took rotation of roles.
* We used a Waterfall style form of development and had frequent meetings to manage progress
* Overall project was completed in Spring 2018
