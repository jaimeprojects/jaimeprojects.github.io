## Welcome! Bienvenidos!


### Why study Philosophy and Computer Science?
Both fields provide an approach to the world, and can be be used in combination to reach new grounds in understanding our existence. Some of the benefits
of high performance computing is the time folding aspect that comes from parallelizing computations that would otherwise take an longer time than necessary
to answer. A nice thought are all the innovations that have come from thinking of what could be and bringing it to reality by manipulating time to our benefit.

### Personal Projects

Some of the projects that you can find here I have contributed to over the course of several months and have helped me become a more rounded software engineer. Other projects I have done on my own out of wanting to build solutions to everyday problems.

For more information about some of my projects go [here!](/portfolio)
