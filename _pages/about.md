## Welcome! Hola!


### Why study Philosophy and Computer Science?
There are a lot of problems that are tackled by both fields using different techniques
Some of them include
* Nature of thinking and computation
* Human cognition and the different ways to build it
* Artificial Intelligence / Cognitive Science

### Perspective
There are practices in software engineering that benefit from a philosophy background because of the nature of field. In one hand I feel that the end user is human and that there are certain aspects of that that should be incorporated into the the development process. There are several solutions out there whether to make the end user more logical to best interface withe the software we make or make the software more intuitive to interface with people

### Personal Projects

Some of the projects that you can find here I have built in teams over the course of several months and have helped me become a more rounded software engineer. Other projects I have done on my own out of wanting to build solutions to everyday problems.

For more information about some of my projects go [here!](/portfolio)

### My Background
I have worked in a number of different industries so far and if you want more information about a specific experience feel free to contact me for additional details.
