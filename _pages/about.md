## Welcome! Hola!
======

### Why study Philosophy and Computer Science?
There are a lot of problems that are tackled by both fields using different techniques
Some of them include
* Nature of thinking and computation
* Human cognition and the different ways to build it
* Artificial Intelligence / Cognitive Science

### Perspective
There are practices in software engineering that benefit from a philosophy background because of the nature of field. In one hand I feel that the end user is human and that there are certain aspects of that that should be incorportated into the the development process. There are several solutions out there whether to make the end user more lofical to best interface withe the software we make or make the software more intuitive to  interface with people
